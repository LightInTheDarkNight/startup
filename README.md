## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown (see notes and this document)
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Imagine a roguelike game that you can cooperate on with your friends! So you can play like a wizard, your friend can hold the knives, and you have to find the exit for the maze-like dungeon! It would adjust the difficulty and size of the dungeon maze depending on how many players were in the game when the level was generated, so you can play in the same game alone and with friends, and it would support an integrated chat so you could collaborate real-time.

### Key features

End goal:
 - Rougelike game is the main functionality, with fully randomly generated dungeons that can change size depending on how many players are present.

 - Chat functionality is the secondary main functionality, with cooperative play and observation the third stage and then enhancements of gameplay the  final stage of development.

 - Each user will have an account to save preferences for gameplay and to enable chat features and friend requests. There may be an option to link to existing platforms at some point, like signing in with Google, Facebook, or even Apple's gamecenter, depending on how far this project gets.

Development path:
1. Basic website frame.                                                           Technologies: HTML, CSS.
2. Login pathway.                                                                 Technologies added: React, authentication.
3. User information persistence.                                                  Technologies added: Database, 3rd party API for user verification.
4. Playable dummy game, maze-like perhaps. Highscore storage and display.         Technologies added: Websocket.
5. Observation of others by username.                                             Technologies: Expanded Websocket. End of CS 260.
6. Friend network and chat.
7. Rouge-like realization.
8. Play with up to four other players, using a pre-game lobby. In-game chat.
9. Play with up to ten other players, dynamic joining and leaving allowed.


### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic Structure and content. Pages for Login, Chat, Play, Friends, Account, etc. Possible reduction with use of React.
- **CSS** - Adaptive styling that looks goood and interesting on a variety of different screen sizes. Smooth and modern appearance and design.
- **React** - Will provide login pipeline, game settings, and game play elements in a streamlined flow. Will help chat experience to be seamless and integrated with other code areas.
- **Service** - Authentication - Use of the third party GetOTP service to verify emails and phone numbers used on the website. Potential integration with SSO providers, including Apple, Google, and Facebook. Chat features potentially added this way. Functinoality endpoint for game observation/multiplayer updating. Testing, temporary endpoint for clearing the database.
- **DB/Login** - The database will give persistence to user data, including login information, highscores, customized characters the players have created and users' chat history. Login will be implemented via react and/or third party SSO.
- **WebSocket** - Data from the server rendered on the user's screen will include realtime chat data, scoring data, friends' statistics and scores, how many players are playing with you or watching you play, and so forth. Initial implementation will be for the dummy game or observation of it.
